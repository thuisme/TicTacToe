After a month learning Python by my own, I challenged myself by writing a small project that users can actually use it instead of solving a problem with a few code sentences. I was lost at first because I didn't know where to start. I asked for recommendations and most replies I received were to recreate with a simple game. That's how TicTacToe was chosen to be my first project. Otherwise, my version is a little bit different than the traditional ones: it contains a 5x5 board instead of a 3x3 and this version is for 2 players. 
My TicTacToe version may not be perfect but I'm delightful for what I've done. I'd love to hear your feedbacks so as to improve my game along with my coding skills. Thank you so much!
